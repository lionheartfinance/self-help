# How to Setup GitHub Pages
*A simple way to understand how GitHub Pages is structured and how you will make changes live.*

#### Requirements Before You Start
* Code Editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) are great)
* A new GitHub Account for each new website you create<br>
*Make sure your username is whatever you want the domain to be.*
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is installed on your computer.

#### Recommended
* General knowledge of HTML/CSS
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) package downloaded
* General understanding of GitHub repositories

## Setting Up GitHub Pages
1. Create a [new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new).
2. Name your repository as `[your username].github.io` and make sure the settings are set to `Public`.
3. Click `Create repository`.
4. Once your repository is created, you will see a button that says `Open in Desktop`.
5. After you have GitHub Desktop opened on your computer, go back to that button and click it.
6. It will open GitHub Desktop and display a modal. Click the `Clone` button.
7. You now have the repository installed locally on your computer. To confirm that this is the case, you can go to My Computer (Windows) or Finder (MacOS) and search for the name of the repository.

## Adding Bootstrap to the Repository
1. Search for `Bootstrap-[Version].zip` in My Computer (Windows) or Finder (MacOS).
2. Unzip the file.
3. Open the folder and find the layout that you want to start with. I suggest using the basic [Starter Template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/starter-template/) or the [Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/jumbotron/) files.
4. Copy the any contents within the folder of the layout you are starting with.
5. Paste these (generally) two files into the repository folder that you found before.
6. Go into GitHub Desktop. On the left side, you should see the names of the files that you just copied over into the repository folder.
7. In the `Summary` field, type `Added Bootstrap to Repo` and click <code>Commit to <strong>master</strong></code>.
8. At the top, click the third box. It should say `Publish`.
9. Allow a few minutes, and then go to your web browser. Navigate to your website by typing the name of the repository in the URL bar.
