# How to Setup GitHub Pages
*A simple way to understand how GitHub Pages is structured and how you will make changes live.*

#### Requirements Before You Start
* Code Editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) are great)
* A new GitHub Account for each new website you create<br>
*Make sure your username is whatever you want the domain to be.*
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is installed on your computer.

#### Recommended
* General knowledge of HTML/CSS
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) package downloaded
* General understanding of GitHub repositories

## Steps to Follow
1. Create a [new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new).
2. Name your repository as `[your username].github.io` and make sure the settings are set to `Public`.
3. Click `Create repository`.
4. Once your repository is created, you will see a button that says `Open in Desktop`.
5. After you have GitHub Desktop opened on your computer, go back to that button and click it.
6. It will open GitHub Desktop and display a modal. Click the `Clone` button.
7. You now have the repository installed locally on your computer. To confirm that this is the case, you can go to My Computer (Windows) or Finder (MacOS) and search for the name of the repository.
